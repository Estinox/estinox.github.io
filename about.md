Hey there! My name is Kevin, and welcome to Centrally Distributed.

If you haven't already guessed from its name, Centrally Distributed is a personal blog about statistics and machine learning. Although, from time to time, you might see a few hobby posts just to prove that I'm not a robot.

## About the Author

Grew up around Toronto, Canada, and went to University of Waterloo for its computer science program. Currently, I'm working at Tower Research Capital as a programmer, helping the group here develop automated short-term trading strategies.

As for my hobbies, you can sometimes find me skiing at big mountains, dabbling with photography, strumming a favorite guitar tune, or listening to my favorite podcasts (gonna recommend Talking Machines and Radiolab here).

Want to get in touch? You can email me at centrally.distributed@gmail.com. Until then, have a browse, make yourself feel at home.
