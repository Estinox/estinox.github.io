Hey there, didn't see you for a sec! I'm Kevin and welcome to Centrally Distributed. 

If you haven't already guessed from its name, Centrally Distributed is a personal blog pivoted around statistics and machine learning. Although from time to time, you might see a few hobby posts tossed in, just to prove that I'm not a robot (or is that what a robot would say?).

# About the Author

Grew up around Toronto, Canada, and went to the University of Waterloo for its computer science program. Currently, I'm working at Tower Research Capital as a programmer, helping the group here develop automated short-term trading strategies.

As for my hobbies, you can sometimes find me skiing at big mountains, dabbling with photography, strumming a new guitar tune, or listening to my favorite podcasts like [Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com), [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money), and [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org).

Want to get in touch? You can drop me a message at centrally.distributed@gmail.com. Until then, have a browse, make yourself feel at home.
