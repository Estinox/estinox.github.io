title: About the Blog

Hey there, didn't see you for a second! My name is Kevin and welcome to Centrally Distributed.

If you haven't already guessed from the title, Centrally Distributed is a personal blog pivoted around statistics and machine learning. Although from time to time, you might see a few hobby posts tossed in, just to prove that I'm not a robot (or is that what a robot would say?).

Part of me wishes that I took more data science related courses during university, but thanks to MOOCs and many great online resources, learning doesn't have to be confined to academic campuses anymore. The primary goal of this blog is force myself to commit understandings in writing, and to think deeply about the topic of each post. Maybe at the same time, to educate any reader who happens to stumble here.

# About the Author

Grew up around Toronto, Canada, and went to the University of Waterloo for its computer science program. Currently, I'm working at Tower Research Capital as a programmer, helping the group here develop automated short-term trading strategies.

As for hobbies, you can sometimes find me skiing at powdery big mountains, dabbling with digital photography, strumming a song that I can't get out of my head, or simply listening to my favorite podcasts like [Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com){:target="_blank"}, [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money){:target="_blank"}, and [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org){:target="_blank"} to name a few.

Want to get in touch? You can drop me a message at centrally.distributed@gmail.com. Until then, have a [browse]({{ site.baseurl }}/site_map/), make yourself feel at home.
